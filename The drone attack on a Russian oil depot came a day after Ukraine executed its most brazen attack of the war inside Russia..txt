On Tuesday, a drone attack on a Russian oil depot came a day after Ukraine executed its most daring attack of the war inside Russia. The attack, which took place in the city of Rostov-on-Don, is the latest in a series of escalating tensions between the two countries.

The attack, which was reportedly conducted by a Ukrainian special forces unit, targeted a major oil depot in the city. According to reports, the attack caused significant damage to the facility, and resulted in the death of at least one Russian soldier.

The Ukrainian government has denied any involvement in the attack, and has accused Russia of staging the attack in order to create a pretext for further military action against Ukraine. Russia, however, has denied any involvement in the attack, and has accused Ukraine of attempting to provoke a conflict.

The attack comes at a time when tensions between the two countries have been escalating. In recent weeks, Ukraine has accused Russia of launching a series of cyberattacks against its government and infrastructure, and has accused Russia of sending troops and military equipment into its territory.

At the same time, Russia has accused Ukraine of escalating the conflict by launching its own military operations in the region. In response, Russia has increased its military presence in the region, and has threatened to use force if Ukraine does not cease its military operations.

The attack on the Russian oil depot is sure to further escalate tensions between the two countries, and could potentially lead to further military action. It is unclear at this time what the response from either side will be, but it is clear that the situation is becoming increasingly volatile.
