It is a common misconception that Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are in constant competition with each other. While the two players have been compared and contrasted for years, there is no evidence that either player is trying to outdo the other. Messi and Ronaldo are both world-class players who have achieved incredible success in their respective careers and they each have their own unique style of play. Therefore, it is unlikely that anything Messi does, Ronaldo does too.
