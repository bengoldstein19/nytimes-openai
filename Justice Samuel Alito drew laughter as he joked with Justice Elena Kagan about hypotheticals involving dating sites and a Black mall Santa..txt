Justice Alito asked Kagan, “Suppose you had a dating site called 'Supreme Court Justice Date.' Would Santa Claus be able to join?”

Kagan replied, “I think Santa Claus should be able to join, but I think he should have to specify his race, because we don't want any discrimination going on.”

Alito then added, “Well, what if he says he's a Black Santa?”

Kagan then quipped, “Then I think we should let him join.”

The exchange drew laughter from the other justices and the lawyers present in the courtroom.
