This is a very concerning development, as it shows that the Russian government is actively circumventing international sanctions in order to continue supplying weapons to its proxies in Ukraine. It is possible that the cruise missiles were smuggled into Ukraine, or that they were produced in Russia and then transported to Ukraine. Either way, it is a clear violation of international law and a direct threat to the security of Ukraine. It is also likely that the cruise missiles were intended for use by Russian-backed separatists in the ongoing conflict in the east of the country. This further demonstrates Russia's disregard for international law and its willingness to use illegal weapons to achieve its political goals.
