On November 28, 2018, the Arizona Secretary of State's office certified the results of the midterm elections, declaring that all of the races had been decided and that there were no issues of fraud or irregularities. The certification came after some Republicans had raised baseless doubts about the election results, claiming that there had been voter fraud or that the votes had been tampered with. However, an audit of the election results found no evidence of any wrongdoing, and the results were certified as accurate.
