The impeachment of Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra is the latest chapter in a long political saga that has seen the country’s leader face accusations of corruption and abuse of power. The process to remove Vizcarra from office has been ongoing since October 2020, when the Peruvian Congress voted to begin proceedings against him. The current impeachment effort is the third time Vizcarra has faced removal from office since he was elected in 2018.

Vizcarra was elected on a platform of reform and anti-corruption measures, promising to restore the public's trust in the government. He quickly implemented a number of measures to combat corruption, including creating an anti-corruption unit and introducing new laws to strengthen transparency and accountability.

However, Vizcarra’s anti-corruption efforts have been met with resistance from the country’s political elite, who have accused him of using his position to benefit himself and his allies. In October 2020, Congress voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Vizcarra, citing “abuses of power” and “violations of the law.”

The current impeachment effort is the third attempt to remove Vizcarra from office. The first effort was launched in 2019, but it was eventually dropped after the Supreme Court ruled that the charges against Vizcarra were unconstitutional. The second effort was launched in 2020, but it was also dropped due to a lack of evidence.

Despite the repeated attempts to remove him from office, Vizcarra has remained committed to his reform agenda. He has continued to push for anti-corruption legislation, and he has proposed a number of measures to address the country’s economic crisis.

The current impeachment process is ongoing, and it is unclear if Vizcarra will be removed from office or allowed to remain in power. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the political situation in Peru is highly volatile and unpredictable.
