The Supreme Court appears set to back a web designer who refused to create a website for a same-sex couple’s commitment ceremony. The case has been seen as a key test of religious liberty rights in the digital age.

The court heard arguments Wednesday in the case of Colorado cake shop owner Jack Phillips, who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in 2012. The couple sued, saying the refusal violated Colorado’s anti-discrimination law.

The court’s conservative majority seemed ready to side with Phillips, with Justice Neil Gorsuch saying that forcing Phillips to create the website would be “coercing him to exercise his artistic expression for an end he finds unacceptable.”

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissenter, saying that the Colorado law was meant to protect people from discrimination and that it should apply to Phillips.

The decision could have far-reaching implications for the rights of religious objectors in the digital age. It could also set a precedent for other cases involving web design, such as the right of a web designer to refuse to create a website for a gun store.

The court is expected to issue its ruling in the coming months.
