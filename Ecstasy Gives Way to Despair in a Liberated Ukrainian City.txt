The city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine has been liberated from the separatist forces that had occupied it for nearly two years. The euphoria of liberation has given way to a sense of despair as the city struggles to rebuild and recover from the conflict. The streets are filled with rubble and the city is facing a severe shortage of basic necessities. Many of the city's residents have been displaced, and those who remain are struggling to make ends meet. Unemployment is high and the economy is in shambles. The city's infrastructure has been severely damaged, and there is no sign of reconstruction in sight. There is also a lack of security, with reports of criminal activity and lawlessness on the rise. As the city struggles to recover, many of its citizens are left feeling hopeless and helpless.
