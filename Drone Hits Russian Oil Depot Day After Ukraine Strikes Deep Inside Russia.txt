On Tuesday, a drone reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia, just one day after Ukrainian forces launched a series of airstrikes deep inside the country.

The incident, which was reported by Russian media, occurred at a depot near the town of Klin in the Moscow region. According to reports, the drone was apparently targeting a Russian military convoy.

The attack comes after Ukrainian forces launched a series of airstrikes against Russian forces in the eastern part of the country on Monday. The strikes were aimed at targets in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, and reportedly caused significant damage to Russian military equipment.

The incident has raised tensions between the two countries, with Russian officials accusing Ukraine of "provocative actions". Ukraine, meanwhile, has accused Russia of using the incident to justify further military action in the region.

The incident also comes amid a broader conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has been ongoing since 2014. The two countries have been locked in a bitter dispute over the status of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. The conflict has also seen both sides accuse each other of supporting separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.

The latest incident is likely to further heighten tensions between the two countries. It remains to be seen if Russia will respond militarily, or if the incident will be used as a pretext for further escalation.
