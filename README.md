Inspired by fakenews.bengoldstien.net, this is an AI generated version of that concept: AI generated news articles.

All of this code was one way or another generated by the chat GPT AI. I started by asking it to write a flask app that has email/password authentication, then began to add features. Example queries were "can you add functionality to the flask app that pulls the titles from new york times articles using HTTP, then feeds those into the OpenAI API to generate contents? Then also write an html template that shows the articles' titles and contents on the homepage. Style the template using bootstrap in an aesthetically pleasing manner similar to a blog." Some of the code didn't run the first time, but I fed all error messages back into Chat-GPT to see if it could do the debugging, which it generally did successfully after max ~3 tries.
