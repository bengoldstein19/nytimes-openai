The responsibility of caring for ‘kinless’ seniors falls to a variety of organizations and individuals. These include local and state governments, social service agencies, churches, non-profit organizations, and volunteers. Governments and social service agencies can provide services such as home care, meal delivery, and transportation. Churches and non-profit organizations can provide companionship and social activities for seniors. Volunteers can provide friendship, support, and assistance with daily living activities.
