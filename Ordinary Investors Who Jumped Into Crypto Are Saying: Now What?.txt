Many ordinary investors who jumped into crypto are now asking themselves what to do next. The simplest answer is to wait and see. The crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable, so it can be difficult to predict what will happen in the short-term. In the meantime, investors should focus on diversifying their holdings and researching other potential investments. Investors should also be aware of the risks associated with investing in crypto and take steps to protect their investments. This can include using a variety of wallets, setting up two-factor authentication, and avoiding scams. Additionally, investors should stay informed about the latest developments in the crypto space and understand the technology behind the projects they are investing in.
