In the race for Georgia's two U.S. Senate seats, Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican David Perdue are in a tight contest, while Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock are in a close race with just days to go before the election.

Warnock, a pastor, has been steadily gaining momentum in recent weeks, and his campaign is banking on a strong turnout on election day to push him over the top. Warnock has been campaigning hard, holding rallies and making appearances on television and radio, and his message of unity and hope has resonated with many voters.

Meanwhile, Loeffler has been relying on her deep pockets and the support of President Donald Trump to help her win. She has been running ads attacking Warnock and touting her own record. Loeffler is banking on a strong turnout from her supporters on election day to put her over the top.

Only time will tell which candidate will prevail in this race, but it is clear that Warnock has gained momentum in recent weeks and is hoping to ride that wave to victory on election day.
